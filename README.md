Have you ever saved different versions of a file? Something like:

story-joe-edit-reviewed.txt
Branches accomplish similar goals in GitHub repositories.

Here at GitHub, our developers, writers, and designers use branches for keeping bug fixes and feature work separate from our master (production) branch. When a change is ready, they merge their branch into master.
